# JavaScript App v2

## how it works

<br>

in the `setup.js` file there is a line with the text

```js
import App from "./App.js";
```

after that we run

```js
const div = document.getElementById("app");

div.innerHTML = App;
```

## Apply Styling

<br>

in the `js` folder there is another folder called `styles`

inside that folder there is a file called `h1.style.js`

### the styling files should end with `.style.js` extension
